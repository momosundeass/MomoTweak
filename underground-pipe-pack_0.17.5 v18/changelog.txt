Version: 0.16.58
Date: ??????
  BugFixes:
    - Temporary fix for Dectorio

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.57
Date: ??????
  Features:
    - Added pipe clamping tool. Just press rotate (Default is R) on a pipe (any mod any pipe) and it will "clamp" it in it's current position. This allows you to build other pipes nearby without them connecting to it. Press R on a clamped pipe to unclamp it.
    - Clamped pipes are able to be blueprinted. Note: when building on a clamped blueprint, single click the item or it will fast-replace it with a regular pipe. This is focused towards being more convenient for bots, as it's a blueprint anyways.
  Changes:
    - Changed default one to two to be perpendicular
    - Changed all fluid boxes to default size
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.56

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.52
Date: ??????
  BugFixes:
    - I messed up the version number in the past. Derp. People can't pull updates properly.
  Features:
    - Added T3 pipes. Distance set to 33.
    - Added varying technology icons to match tier
    - Pipe Couplers. For all underground connections. Tiered.
    - Added custom intermediate items to reduce pipespam, clear up inventory clutter, and make the mod less cheaty.
  Changes:
    - Changed costs of research
    - T1, 50 Red
    - T2, 100 Red/Green
    - T3, 200 Red/Green/Blue
    - Changed pipes to "carry" more fluid. Testing on this one. May revert to regular pipe value.
    - T1 stays at 100 units.
    - T2 will be 150 units.
    - T3 will be 200 units.
    - Restructured build costs of all pipes to work with new items.
    - All pipe entities in mod now cost 5 segments per leg, appropriate pipe couplers for each underground port, and a pipe for the surface. Underground pipes do not cost a pipe.
    - Rotateable pipes-to-ground also cost 1 swivel joint
    - Because of above changes, regular pipe to ground entities are no longer rotateable. You must build the custom one-to-one pipe.

    - Added T2 pipes. Distance set to 22.
    - Added second tier research. Requires red and green research (30 units).
  Changes:
    - Rebalanced all costs. Every underground segment costs a pipe. Previous design was giving away free pipe lengths (1 pipe per leg underground)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.8
Date: ??????
  Changes:
    - Altered included 4-to-4 pipe to 11 underground depth to match other pipes in pack
    - Due to multiple requests, and re-assessment of use of these items, flag replaced to "goes-to-quickbar" instead of "goes-to-main-inventory"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: ??????
  Features:
    - Added a hotkey that will ping and show currently connected underground pipes for 15 seconds nearby you.
