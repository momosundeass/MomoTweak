oil 
-- heavy oil residue
-- bottom resid oil
-- naphtha
-- kerosene 
-- netural gas
-- reformate


---| heavy oil residue = fuel + coke
---| naphtha + water = light oil  
---| kerosene + steam = naphtha + petro gas
---| crude oil + steam = kerosene + netural gas



Quantum computer and research server loop. Use percentage result and ingredients loop to create a pair of buildings.
IngA can be crafted from stuff.
IngA -> [research server] 
20% resultA + IngB
IngB -> [Quantum com] 
25% resultA + IngA
resultA + IngB -> Final result
Maybe add some cooling ingredients

Spoilage singularity tech card, encourage building quantum computer near lab.
